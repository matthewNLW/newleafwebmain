                                        <h4>Context</h4>
                                        <p>Safer Shores was created to support Georgetown County’s beach safety signage initiative by providing a simple, reliable way for beachgoers to access critical information at their specific beach access point. Because the signage relied on QR codes, the website needed to function quickly and predictably in real world beach conditions.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Constraint</h4>
                                        <p>The primary constraint was connectivity. Cell service along the beach is often weak or inconsistent, which meant the site could not rely on heavy assets, complex navigation, or slow-loading components. The design also needed to be immediately understandable for a wide range of users, including families, visitors, and non-technical audiences.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Design Intention</h4>
                                        <p>The intention behind this work was to create a fast loading, easy to navigate informational site so that users on the beach could scan a QR code and immediately access all relevant safety and location specific information without friction.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                                        <p>I built a lightweight, QR-driven system that acts as a central hub and branches to trusted external information sources as needed. The site prioritizes speed, clarity, and minimal interaction cost, ensuring users can quickly find what they need even on poor connections. Every design and structural decision was made with performance and usability in mind rather than visual complexity.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Outcome</h4>S
                                        <p>Safer Shores is live and in public use, supporting county beach access signage and helping visitors quickly orient themselves and access beach safety information tied to their location.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Reflection</h4>
                                        <p>This project sharpened my approach to aggressive performance optimization and reinforced the importance of designing for real world conditions rather than ideal ones. Working within limited connectivity pushed me to focus on what truly matters to users in time sensitive environments.</p>

                                        <h4>Context</h4>
                                        <p>Cat Daddy’s Cat Café had an outdated website that no longer supported how the business actually operated. Important information about cat room availability and events was difficult to keep current, and bookings were managed through paper-based systems that created extra work and limited flexibility for the owner.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Constraint</h4>
                                        <p>The project needed to account for non-technical users while replacing manual workflows with something easier rather than more complicated. Any new system had to be intuitive enough to use daily and reliable enough to become part of normal operations without requiring ongoing technical involvement.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Design Intention</h4>
                                        <p>The intention behind this work was to modernize the front end and introduce an admin system that allows the owner to update cat room information and event details independently, giving them direct control over their website content.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                                        <p>The front end was redesigned to clearly guide visitors toward booking a cat room or attending an event, while removing unnecessary friction in the user flow. Behind the scenes, a custom admin interface was created so staff can manage content without editing code. The system was designed to feel simple and predictable, mirroring the way the business already thinks about its day-to-day operations.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Outcome</h4>
                                        <p>The frontend redesign is partially live, with continued development underway to complete the full system. The website has shifted from a static presence into a functional tool that supports both customers and internal operations.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Reflection</h4>
                                        <p>This project strengthened my understanding of backend data structures and reinforced how important it is to design admin tools that respect the skill level and time constraints of small business owners.</p>

                                        <h4>Context</h4>
                                        <p>Civic Infrastructure Group did not have a website and lacked a digital presence to communicate their experience and credibility to potential clients. Without a public facing site, it was difficult for the business to clearly explain its services or establish trust with new consulting opportunities.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Constraint</h4>
                                        <p>Budget limitations shaped the scope of the project and required a focused approach. Rather than building a full multi page website, the work centered on a single landing page that could clearly present experience and expertise without unnecessary complexity.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Design Intention</h4>
                                        <p>The intention behind this work was to create a simple portfolio landing page that establishes a professional digital consulting presence and gives potential clients a clear place to understand the firm’s background and strengths.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                                        <p>I designed a streamlined, design-focused landing page that highlights key areas of expertise and professional experience. The layout prioritizes clarity and credibility, using a proven structure that allows visitors to quickly understand the business without distraction. The goal was to support the client’s strengths rather than overshadow them with unnecessary design elements.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Outcome</h4>
                                        <p>The site is live and provides Civic Infrastructure Group with a functional and professional online presence that can be shared with prospective clients.</p>

                                        <p>This project was created as a design exploration focused on how an online marketplace might present physical products in a way that feels intentional rather than transactional. The goal was not to replicate a full ecommerce experience, but to study how visual hierarchy and pacing can influence perception and curiosity.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Constraint</h4>
                                        <p>The concept was intentionally limited to design only, with no checkout or payment flow. By removing commerce mechanics, the focus remained on presentation, storytelling, and how products are introduced to the viewer within a single multi product landing page.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Design Intention</h4>
                                        <p>The intention behind this work was to present coffee making products as luxurious and exclusive so that viewers would feel intrigued and motivated to explore each product more deeply.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                                        <p>I designed a multi product landing page featuring three coffee products, each presented with clear specifications and visual emphasis. The layout relies on controlled spacing, restrained color choices, and smooth transitions to create a sense of refinement. Scroll based animations were used deliberately to guide attention and slow the experience, reinforcing the feeling of quality rather than speed.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Outcome</h4>
                                        <p>This project serves as a design playground and reference implementation, allowing experimentation with layout, animation, and visual tone without the constraints of a production ecommerce system.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Reflection</h4>
                                        <p>This concept reinforced how powerful subtle scroll animations and carefully chosen color schemes can be in shaping perception. The techniques explored here now inform my client work when designing experiences that need to feel premium, calm, and intentional rather than busy or sales driven.</p>

                                        <p>This project was created as a design exploration focused on how a real estate development firm might present a large volume of visual content without overwhelming the viewer. Real estate portfolios often rely heavily on imagery, and this concept was an opportunity to study how property showcases can remain clear, professional, and visually calm.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Constraint</h4>
                                        <p>The design intentionally limited text usage in order to create more space on the page and allow images to carry the narrative. By reducing written content, the layout needed to communicate value and credibility through structure, spacing, and visual rhythm alone.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Design Intention</h4>
                                        <p>The intention behind this work was to present a real estate development firm’s portfolio in a way that highlights completed properties while maintaining a design friendly and professional experience.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                                        <p>The site focuses on showcasing developed properties through large, carefully spaced visuals paired with only the most essential supporting text. A minimalist approach was used to emphasize quality over quantity, ensuring that each property feels considered and intentional rather than crowded. The design prioritizes balance and restraint to support a high-end presentation.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Outcome</h4>
                                        <p>This project functions as an internal experiment and design reference, serving as a controlled environment to test layout strategies for image heavy sites in the real estate space.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Reflection</h4>
                                        <p>This concept reinforced the importance of white space in creating a premium feel. By keeping text minimal and purposeful, the design allows the content to breathe and speak for itself, a principle that now directly informs how I approach visually driven client work.</p>

                                        <p>This project was created as a design exploration focused on how an event venue website can communicate the flow of a single, meaningful day. Rather than presenting a venue as a generic space, the goal was to help visitors mentally walk through the experience of an event from beginning to end.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Constraint</h4>
                                        <p>The concept intentionally pushed experimentation with hero layout and text sizing. By forcing changes in scale and hierarchy, the design needed to guide attention clearly without relying on excessive content or complex interactions.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Design Intention</h4>
                                        <p>The intention behind this work was to create an event venue site centered on a single-day experience so that potential clients could easily imagine what their special day would look and feel like in that space.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                                        <p>I designed a site that showcases a wedding venue through a combination of imagery and narrative explanations that follow the progression of the day. Text size was used deliberately to establish emphasis and pacing, allowing key moments to stand out while supporting details remained visually quieter. The layout encourages visitors to move naturally through the experience rather than scanning disconnected sections.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Outcome</h4>
                                        <p>This project functions as a portfolio reference and internal experiment, providing a controlled environment to study how scale, hierarchy, and storytelling interact in event-focused design.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Reflection</h4>
                                        <p>This concept sharpened my understanding of how text size can be used to create visual pyramids that guide attention and reinforce narrative flow. By varying scale intentionally, the design communicates importance without adding clutter or complexity.</p>
